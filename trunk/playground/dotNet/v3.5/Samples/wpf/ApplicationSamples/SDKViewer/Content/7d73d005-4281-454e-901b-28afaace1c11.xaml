      <Paragraph>Your choice of hosting options affects the security settings that apply to your application, and how the application can be deployed. Although they are not applications in the strict sense, the same considerations also apply to Windows Presentation Foundation custom components. There are two primary ways to host Windows Presentation Foundation applications on your user's system.

      <Paragraph FontSize="22">Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications    
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>XAML Browser Applications are intended to combine the best features of Web applications and rich-client applications. Like a Web application, the user can deploy them from a server to their system with a single click. The application then runs in the browser without any interruptions beyond the time needed to download the application. However, unlike the relatively limited graphics and media capabilities of HTML-based applications, XAML Browser Applications have access to the rich features of the Windows Presentation Foundation runtime. Here are the basic characteristics of XAML Browser Applications.    
      </Paragraph>

      <List MarkerStyle="Disc">
        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Hosting. XAML Browser Applications are always hosted in the browser.

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Creating and Building. You create and build XAML Browser Applications in much the same way that you do installed applications. The difference is largely a matter of compiler settings. If you stick to those elements that run in the Internet zone, the same code can be switched from one to the other by just changing a few property settings in the project file and recompiling. See <Hyperlink NavigateUri="aefbe9d1-2bca-4bbb-9406-796980eeca63.xaml">Creating, Building, Deploying, and Launching WPF Applications</Hyperlink>
 and <Hyperlink NavigateUri="0d1b40a7-069c-4832-9764-b1c6bb8900df.xaml">Creating, Building, and Deploying a XAML Browser Application</Hyperlink>

        <ListItem>

            <ListItem>
              <Paragraph>.exe.manifest. The application manifest. This contains the standard application metadata that is created for any managed application.

            <ListItem>
              <Paragraph>.exe. The application's executable code.

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Deployment. Users deploy a XAML Browser Application by navigating to the application's .xbap file, which invokes ClickOnce to download the application. XAML Browser Applications can only be deployed with ClickOnce, which automatically handles the process of downloading and running the application. See <Hyperlink NavigateUri="0d1b40a7-069c-4832-9764-b1c6bb8900df.xaml">Creating, Building, and Deploying a XAML Browser Application</Hyperlink>
 for details on the mechanics of deploying a XAML Browser Application from a server. You can launch a XAML Browser Application from your local system by double-clicking it, and ClickOnce will launch it in your browser. You cannot launch the application's .exe file.        
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Security. When you deploy a XAML Browser Application from a server with ClickOnce, it runs in a sandbox with Internet zone permissions. This limits the application's access to potentially risky system resources such as the file system or registry. To the extent that potentially risky system access is available, the user will always be informed and have an opportunity to reject the action. For example, you can only store data in the file system by launching the <Run FontWeight="Bold">File Open</Run>
 dialog box. The user must then explicitly allow the data to be written to the hard drive. If you launch a .xbap file that you have created on your local system, it runs in the browser with local zone permissions. This is useful when developing an application, but you should also deploy it from a server to make sure that the application runs properly with Internet zone permissions.         
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>User permission. Since XAML Browser Applications run in a sandbox, no user permission is required to run them. The user clicks the link, which is connected to the application's deployment manifest, and the application just runs.        
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Installation. XAML Browser Applications are not installed. They do not have shell presence. To run them again, the user must navigate to the server and click the link. If the application is still cached, ClickOnce runs it, otherwise, ClickOnce downloads and runs the application as before.        
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Shell presence. Because they are not installed, XAML Browser Applications are not registered with the shell. They do not appear in the <Run FontWeight="Bold">Start</Run>
 menu or the <Run FontWeight="Bold">Add or Remove Programs</Run>
 control panel application.        
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Persistence and offline use. XAML Browser Applications do not persist once they are closed, so they cannot be used offline. However, they can use isolated storage to store data that can then be accessed by the next instance of the application.        
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>Windows Presentation Foundation features. XAML Browser Applications have access to most Windows Presentation Foundation features. However, some Windows Presentation Foundation features are not available in the Internet zone. See <Hyperlink NavigateUri="55ca384d-fd7d-490e-9846-020b1d032483.xaml">Security</Hyperlink>

          <Paragraph>Deployment. Installed applications can be deployed from a server, using either ClickOnce or MSI. They can also be installed from media such as a CD. If you double-click a .application file on your system, ClickOnce installs it, after displaying a trust prompt. If you double-click an .exe file that you have created on your local system, it simply runs. There is no trust prompt. This is useful when developing an application, but you should test the deployed application to ensure that it works properly with the system.

 for details. With installed applications, you have to decide between two deployment options: ClickOnce and MSI. Here's a brief and somewhat oversimplified summary of the two options.

      <List MarkerStyle="Disc">
        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>ClickOnce is the simplest solution, especially for web deployment. It is the only option for XAML Browser Applications. The deployment manifest is essentially a byproduct of compilation. You just need to host it on a server and ClickOnce takes care of the details. ClickOnce has automatic updating built in. However, ClickOnce is limited in what it can install and how it can install it. Also, it cannot be used to install components, and it cannot install applications or components from media such as a CD.         
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

        <ListItem>
          <Paragraph>MSI requires more work on the developers part, and lacks the browser-integration of ClickOnce. However, it provides much more power and flexibility than is possible with ClickOnce. It is the only option for components, and it can be used to install applications or components from media such as a CD.        
          </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>

      <Paragraph>As a rule of thumb, MSI is typically the best choice for large, complex applications and the only choice for components.
