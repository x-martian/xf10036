      <Paragraph>An application that uses Windows Presentation Foundation typically consists of a collection of Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) pages and their supporting procedural code. However, the functionality that a collection of independent pages provides, is too limiting for most applications. In addition to page-level processing, applications usually need to perform tasks like storing page state when the user goes to a different page, passing data between pages, and detecting when a new page loads.     
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>This topic shows you how to use the application model that Windows Presentation Foundation provides to make a collection of XAML pages into a flexible, fully-functional application.

      <Paragraph>You can host Windows Presentation Foundation applications in two primary ways: Web Browser and installed applications. Your choice of hosting options also determines the security settings that apply to your application, and how you intend to deploy the application.

They are installed on the user's computer and can run offline as well as online. They have full access to operating system resources;so the user must give explicit permission to install and run them.

      <Paragraph>Windows Presentation Foundation components, such as custom controls, are similar to installed applications with regard to hosting, deployment, and security settings. The primary difference is that components are packaged in a dynamic-link library (DLL) for use by applications and are not directly available to the user.

      <Paragraph>Applications that use Windows Presentation Foundation are usually similar to Web applications. Typically, users interact with a page and then click a link or other user interface (UI) element that navigates them to the next page and displays it. The navigation API of the application model provides powerful and flexible programmatic support for navigation, including:

      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Windows Presentation Foundation does not support the use of its APIs in the context of a service. This is because many areas of these APIs touch upon the presentation aspects of applications, such as rendering to the interface;or related functions, such as printing or composition, where users are expected to interact with the application. If the service context does not have permissions to perform these operations, calls to these Windows Presentation Foundation APIs have unexpected results.
