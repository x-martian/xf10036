    <Paragraph>Because of the way Microsoft UI Automation uses Windows messages, conflicts can occur when a client application attempts to interact with its own UI on the UI thread. These conflicts can lead to very slow performance or even cause the application to stop responding.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>If your client application is intended to interact with all elements on the desktop, including its own UI, you should make all UI Automation calls on a separate thread. This includes locating elements (for example, by using TreeWalker or the FindAll method) and using <Run>control patterns</Run>
. 
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>It is safe to make UI Automation calls within a UI Automation event handler, because the event handler is always called on a non-UI thread. However, when subscribing to events that may originate from your client application's UI, you must make the call to AddAutomationEventHandler, or a related method, on a non-UI thread. Remove event handlers on the same thread.
