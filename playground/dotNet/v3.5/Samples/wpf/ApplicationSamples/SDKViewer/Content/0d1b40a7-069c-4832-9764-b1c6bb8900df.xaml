      <Paragraph>XAML Browser Applications are intended to combine the best features of Web applications and rich-client applications. As with a Web application, XAML Browser Applications can be deployed from a server to a system with a single click. The application then runs in the browser without any interruptions beyond the time needed to download the application. However, unlike the relatively limited graphics and media capabilities of HTML-based applications, XAML Browser Applications have access to the rich features of the Windows Presentation Foundation runtime. See Blackjack Express Demo for an example of a simple but fully functional XAML Browser Application.    
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>For the most part, developing a XAML Browser Application is a matter of standard Windows Presentation Foundation programming, and is very similar to installed applications. See <Hyperlink NavigateUri="aefbe9d1-2bca-4bbb-9406-796980eeca63.xaml">Creating, Building, Deploying, and Launching WPF Applications</Hyperlink>
 for a general introduction. This topic discusses aspects of implementing, debugging, and deploying that are specific to XAML Browser Applications.

      <Paragraph>This template creates a navigation application with an application definition, MyApp.xaml, and a single page, Page1.xaml. You can add to those as necessary.

      <Paragraph>XAML Browser Applications need to work within the restrictions imposed by the Internet zone permission set. As a practical matter, this means that you must restrict your implementation to that subset of Windows Presentation Foundation elements that is valid with Internet zone permissions. You are also limited in how you can access system resources such as the file system and registry, and your application cannot use unmanaged code. See <Hyperlink NavigateUri="55ca384d-fd7d-490e-9846-020b1d032483.xaml">Security</Hyperlink>
 for a list of valid elements. This means that any XAML Browser Application can be recompiled as an installed application, because installed applications do not have these security restrictions. Installed applications can be recompiled as XAML Browser Applications as well, but only if they are compatible with the Internet permission set. If you attempt to exceed these permissions, your application will typically throw a security exception. The requirements include:

      <Paragraph>You can run or debug the application from Visual Studio 2005 in exactly the same way as for an installed application. The main difference is that the application is launched in the browser instead of a stand-alone window. When you debug, your application is running in the Internet zone and will throw exceptions if you attempt to exceed those permissions.

      <Paragraph>When you build a XAML Browser Application, the Microsoft build engine (MSBuild) typically produces three files.

      <Paragraph>You deploy XAML Browser Applications from a server with Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) version 5 or later. It is not necessary to have the Windows Presentation Foundation runtime on the server to deploy Windows Presentation Foundation applications from it. However, you do need to register the Windows Presentation Foundation  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types and file extensions. See <Hyperlink NavigateUri="c6e8c2cb-9ba2-4e75-a0d5-180ec9639433.xaml">How to: Configure a Web Server to Deploy WPF Applications</Hyperlink>
 for details.    
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>To prepare your XAML Browser Application for deployment, simply copy the .exe and the associated manifests to your webserver. Create a link on an appropriate Web page that navigates to the applications deployment manifest. When the user clicks the link and navigates to the .XBAP file, ClickOnce automatically handles the mechanics of downloading and launching the application.
