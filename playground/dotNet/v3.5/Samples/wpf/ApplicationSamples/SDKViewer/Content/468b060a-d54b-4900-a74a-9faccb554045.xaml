    <Paragraph>Microsoft exposes a variety of community resources for you to learn about, discuss, and provide feedback on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), including blogs produced by WPF team members and community leaders, forums, and the Microsoft Product Feedback Center. Each community resource offers a different set of benefits. These benefits are described here, as are a set of best practices for using each to ensure the best response from the community at large and Microsoft in particular.

    <Paragraph>Microsoft WPF team members and community leaders author a variety of <Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/articles/475132.aspx">blogs</Hyperlink>
 that target WPF in general, or subsets of WPF specifically. Content generally ranges from product developments, motivations, and philosophies, to detailed discussion of specific scenarios, issues, and API. Additionally, you can discuss or inquire further about posts that interest you with people who have the deepest understanding of the platform.

    <Paragraph>Note that, while an issue may be WPF-related, the WPF forum might not be the most appropriate place to raise it. For example, your issue might be specific to a WPF tool, including Expression Graphic Designer (<Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/graphic_designer/default.mspx">home</Hyperlink>
), Expression Interactive Designer (<Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/interactive_designer/default.mspx">home</Hyperlink>
) or the WPF Designer (<Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">home</Hyperlink>
). In these cases, you should use the following forums:

    <Paragraph FontSize="18">Forum Best Practices
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Using the following best practices help to address issues posted to the WPF forum in the quickest possible time. These practices are applicable to all forums.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Search Existing Posts
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Some issues occur widely enough that others have faced them before you. Consequently, you can solve your problem quickly, or you can add your input to an existing discussion.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Use Meaningful Titles
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Concise, meaningful titles improve the discoverability of your posts, and make it easier for other WPF forum community members to determine if they can solve your problem.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Include Appropriate Content
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>You should describe the issue and how you’ve tried to work through it. If possible, include supporting code snippets, or the simplest possible sample that demonstrates your issue. All these details help to increase the chance your question will be answered quickly.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>A complete set of forum best practices can be found <Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://www.microsoft.com/wn3/locales/help/help_en-us.xaml">online</Hyperlink>
.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="22">Product Feedback Center
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Issues can sometimes be difficult to resolve, or irresolvable. Such situations arise because of bugs in the technology, difficulties applying the technology to particular scenarios, or lack of support for particular scenarios. This information is important to Microsoft, and can be provided via the <Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback">Product Feedback Center</Hyperlink>
.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Items posted on the WPF Product Feedback Center are routed to the WPF team's internal bug database. Consequently, it is the most reliable way to get your feedback to the WPF feature owner. In addition, you can validate and track suggestions and bugs as well as vote on them, which helps the WPF team prioritize issues.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="18">WPF Product Feedback Center Best Practices
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>When posting to the WPF Product Feedback Center, searching existing posts, providing a meaningful title and appropriate content are important best practices, just as they are for posting to the WPF forum. The following are additional best practices you should also employ. 
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Search Existing Posts
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Some issues occur widely enough that others have faced them before you. Consequently, you can solve your problem quickly, or you can add your input to an existing discussion.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Use Meaningful Titles
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Concise, meaningful titles increase the chance that your issue is directed to the most appropriate WPF team in the shortest amount of time. This is particularly important for a technology like WPF, which contains many interrelated features.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Describe How to Reproduce Your Bug
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>When you post about a bug, it is important to include the following where relevant:
    </Paragraph>

    <List MarkerStyle="Disc">
      <ListItem>
        <Paragraph>Provide a clear description of the bug.
        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        <Paragraph>Use code snippets to support the bug description.
        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        <Paragraph>Provide a list of steps that demonstrate how to reproduce the bug.
        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        <Paragraph>Include the smallest possible code sample that reproduces the bug.
        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        <Paragraph>Mention whether the bug is consistently reproducible or not.
        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        <Paragraph>Include relevant exception information.
        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

    </List>

    <Paragraph>If the bug is install or setup related, attach the relevant install logs and snapshots (files prefixed with "dd_" that are located in your %temp% folder).
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>For compile or build issues, attach the build logs. The <Hyperlink NavigateUri="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wea2sca5(VS.80).aspx">MSBuild</Hyperlink>
 system can be configured to supports logging with various verbosities by using the /v: switch from the command line or by configuring the appropriate level from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Microsoft Visual Studio.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Provide Environment Information
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Background information can often be useful for adding context to your post. In particular, mention the operating system platform, processor family, and architecture, eg "Windows XP SP2, Pentium III, x86.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>If the issue you are posting about is related to rendering, you should also include graphics card and driver details, if possible. This information is important because WPF is a presentation framework.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Provide Solution or Project Information
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Bugs may pertain to the tools used to develop and build your applications and the types of applications you are building. Consequently, it can be useful to specify:

 types?

        </Paragraph>

      </ListItem>

    </List>

    <Paragraph FontSize="16pt">Provide Scenario and Impact Information
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Information about the scenario that manifests the bug and its impact is highly important to the WPF team when it decides if, when, and how a problem should be fixed, or whether an acceptable workaround can be used instead.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Ordinarily, crash and data loss scenarios are high impact and, therefore, the easiest to prioritize. Some bugs, however, only show up in uncommon scenarios, which may also be mainline scenarios in some cases. Providing context around scenario and impact helps the WPF team make the right decision.
