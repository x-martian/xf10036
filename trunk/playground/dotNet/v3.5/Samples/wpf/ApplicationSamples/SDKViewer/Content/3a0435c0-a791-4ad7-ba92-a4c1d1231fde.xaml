    <Paragraph>This overview describes how Microsoft UI Automation can be useful as a framework for programmatic access in automated testing scenarios.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>UI Automation provides a unified object model that enables all user interface (UI) frameworks to expose complex and rich functionality in an accessible and easily automated manner.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>UI Automation was developed as a successor to Microsoft Active Accessibility. Active Accessibility is an existing framework designed to provide a solution for making controls and applications accessible. Active Accessibility was not designed with test automation in mind even though it evolved into that role due to the very similar requirements of accessibility and automation. UI Automation, in addition to providing more refined solutions for accessibility, is also specifically designed to provide robust functionality for automated testing. For example, Active Accessibility relies on a single interface to both expose information about the UI and collect the information needed by AT products; 
UI Automation separates the two models.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Both a <Run>provider</Run>
 and <Run>client</Run>
 are required to implement UI Automation for it to be useful as an automated test tool. UI Automation providers are applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and other third-party applications or controls based on the Microsoft Windows operating system. UI Automation clients include automated test scripts and assistive technology applications.

    <Paragraph FontSize="22">UI Automation in a Provider
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>For a UI to be automated, a developer of an application or control must look at what actions an end-user can perform on the UI object using standard keyboard and mouse interaction. 
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Once these key actions have been identified, the corresponding UI Automation <Run>control patterns</Run>
 (that is, the control patterns that mirror the functionality and behavior of the UI element) should be implemented on the control. For example, user interaction with a combo box control (such as the run dialog) typically involves expanding and collapsing the combo box to hide or display a list of items, selecting an item from that list, or adding a new value via keyboard input.

          <TableCell>
            <Paragraph>With other accessibility models, developers must gather information directly from individual buttons, menus, or other controls. Unfortunately, every control type comes in dozens of minor variations. In other words, even though ten variations of a pushbutton may all work the same way and perform the same function, they must all be treated as unique controls. There is no way to know that these controls are functionally equivalent. Control patterns were developed to represent these common control behaviors.

    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>As mentioned earlier, without the unified model provided by UI Automation, test tools and developers are required to know framework-specific information in order to expose properties and behaviors of controls in that framework. Since there can be several different UI frameworks present at any single time within Windows operating systems, including Win32, Windows Forms, and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), it can be a daunting task to test multiple applications with controls that seem similar. For example, the following table outlines the framework-specific property names required to retrieve the name (or text) associated with a button control and shows the single equivalent UI Automation property.

    <Paragraph FontSize="22">UI Automation in a Client
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>The goal of many automated test tools and scenarios is the consistent and repeatable manipulation of the user interface. This can involve unit testing specific controls through to the recording and playback of test scripts that iterate through a series of generic actions on a group of controls. 
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>A complication that arises from automated applications is the difficulty synchronizing a test with a dynamic target. For example, a list box control, such as one contained in the Windows Task Manager, that displays a list of currently running applications. Since the items in the list box are dynamically updated outside the control of the test application, attempting to repeat the selection of a specific item in the list box with any consistency is impossible. Similar issues can also arise when attempting to repeat simple focus changes in a UI that is outside the control of the test application.
